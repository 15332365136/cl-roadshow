<td>Thread pooling helps to save the VM the work of creating and destroying threads when they can be easily recycled.

<td>Thread pooling reduces response time because the
    thread is already created, started, and running. It's only waiting for the signal to <b><i>go</i></b>!</td>

  <td>Thread pooling holds resource usage to a predetermined upper 
  	limit. Instead of starting a new thread for every request
      received by an HTTP server, a set of workers is
available to
      service requests. When this set is being completely
used by
      other requests, the server does not increase its load,
but
      rejects requests until a worker becomes available.</td>
